title: Welcome!

After a while thinking about creating a blog, I finally decided to give it a go, thus here we are: _welcome to my blog_. <br>

#### Let me introduce myself in one sentence
I'm a graduated engineer from France, living in Montreal after accomplishing a master degree in telecommunication and network. <br>

#### A bit more background
I have studied six years in computer science and networking (four in France, two in Canada).
At the beginning, anything that interested me was smartphones, either iOS and Android. So I learned how to program and develop apps for both those platforms, but in the end it was all about the Google open source platform: Android. From a developer perspective, open source is the way to go because you can either contribute and/or leverage the existing and customize it as desired. I won't argue about open source vs proprietary here because that is not the aim of my blog, and in my own opinion the battle already has a winner. <br>
In parallel, I studied classic networking, but was mostly interested in wireless and mobile networking. It's only in the sixth year of my university course that I heard about Software Defined Network (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV); two main paradigms revisiting our vision of the network.
Being an application developer in my spare time, and having the basic networking knowledge, I knew I have to be part of this movement. <br>

#### To sum up ...
... what I think, I will quote Marc Andreessen (creator of Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm): "<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460"><b>Software is eating the world</b></a>". <br>

#### Great point of view
Here is a presentation signed <a href="http://ben-evans.com">Benedict Evans</a>, one of Andreessen Horowitz's employee. The video showcases pretty well the evolution of smartphone, and its adoption.
