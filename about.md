I try to work out what's going on and what will happen next, and will talk about it in blog posts.
This blog will also be a _how to_ kind of blog for OpenDaylight.
## Inocybe Technologies
<p align="justify">
I work at [Inocybe Technologies](http://www.inocybe.com/), a technological firm based in Gatineau, Quebec. Through its [Open Networking Platform](https://platform.inocybe.com/), Inocybe delivers production ready OpenDaylight distributions and environments, based of recipes.</br>
Working at Inocybe Technologies, I support companies in leveraging OpenDaylight within their products and services, lessening the network complexity and ultimately solving their networking challenges.

## OpenDaylight
<p align="justify">
I an involved in many OpenDaylight projects, with a focus on supporting and promoting best practices. I aspire to create a global shared structure across projects that would lower the barrier for new committers to be able to easily ramp up and hack on OpenDaylightâ€™s codebase. </br> 
I joined the community during the early Lithium release, and have since been a day-to-day contributor. </br>
