I try to work out what's going on and what will happen next, and will talk about it in blog posts.
This blog will also be a _how to_ kind of blog for OpenDaylight.
## Inocybe Technologies
<p align="justify">
I work at [Inocybe Technologies](http://www.inocybe.com/), a technological firm based in Ottawa that develops SDN / NFV solutions.
At Inocybe Technologies, we mostly focus on open source technologies. My day to day duty is to contribute to [OpenDaylight](https://www.opendaylight.org/). <br>
